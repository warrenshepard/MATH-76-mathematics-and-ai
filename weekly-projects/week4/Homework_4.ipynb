        "In this week's project, you will explore the COMPAS data set. COMPAS stands for \"Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions\". It is a software/algorithm that is used to assess the risk of a registered offender is going to commit another offense. Although researchers and journalists have pointed to [various problems](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) of this algorithm over many years, the algorithm is still used to inform sentences and parole decisions in several US states.\n",
        "You can learn more about the COMPAS data set [here](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/compas-recidivism-risk-score-data-and-analysis).\n",
        "\n",
        "Through this project, you will practice fitting and validating several classification models and you will explore some distinct benefits of using decision trees in machine learning. As part of that exploration, you are going to audit your model for demographic biases via a \"closed box\" and an \"open box\" approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "The COMPAS data set is a favorite example among critics of machine learning because it demonstrates several shortcomings and failure modes of machine learning techniques. The lessons learned from this project might be discouraging, and they are important. Keep in mind, however, that what you see here does not generalize to all data sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project has four parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Part 1: Prepare the COMPAS data set  (PARTIALLY YOU TO COMPLETE)\n",
        "\n",
        "In this part, you will load the COMPAS data set, explore its content, and select several variables as features (i.e., queries) or class labels (i.e., responses). Some of these features are not numerical, so you will need to replace some categorical values with zeros and ones. Your features will include categorical variable with more than two categories. You will uses 1-hot encoding to include this feature in your data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "This part includes four steps:\n",
        "1. Load and explore data set\n",
        "2. Select features and response variables\n",
        "3. Construct numerical coding for categorical features\n",
        "4. Split the data\n",
        "\n",
        "### Part 2: Train and validate a decision tree  (PARTIALLY YOU TO COMPLETE)\n",
        "\n",
        "In this part, you will fit a decision tree to your data. You will examine the effect of tuning the complexity of the tree via the \"maximum number of leaves\" parameter and use 5-fold cross-validation to find an optimal value.\n",
        "\n",
        "This part includes three steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Fit a decision tree on the training data\n",
        "2. Tune the parameter \"maximum number of leaves\"\n",
        "3. Calculate the selected model's test performance\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Part 3: Auditing a decision tree for demographic biases  (PARTIALLY YOU TO COMPLETE)\n",
        "\n",
        "Your training data includes several demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, race). A crude way to assess whether a model has some demographic bias is to remove the corresponding variables from your training data and explore how that removal affects your model's performance. Decision trees have the advantage of being interpretable machine learning models. By going through the decision nodes (i.e., branching points), you can \"open the black box and look inside\". Specifically, you can assess how each feature is used in the decision making process.\n",

        "3. Check for racial bias via decision rules\n",
        "\n",
        "### Part 4: Comparison to other linear classifiers (FOR YOU TO COMPLETE)\n",
        "\n",
        "For some types of data, decision trees tend to achieve lower prediction accuracies In this part, you will train and tune several classifiers on the COMPAS data. You will then compare their performance on your test set.\n",

Decision trees have the advantage of being interpretable machine learning models. By going through the decision nodes (i.e., branching points), you can \"open the black box and look inside\".
